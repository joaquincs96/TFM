## Abstract

Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in human blood, are pivotal in the immune response to inflammation. Their dynamic behavior and functional diversity, shaped by varied stimuli, make them important agents in inflammation context. The zebrafish model, with its amenability to genetic manipulation and transgenic lines expressing fluorescent proteins, offers an exceptional model for visualizing and studying immune cells live, including neutrophils. Recent advances such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have enriched our understanding of neutrophil biology. However, these techniques are limited as they capture only static snapshots and do not account for cellular dynamics. This project focus in a novel approach to analyze behavioral changes in neutrophils within a zebrafish model of chronic skin inflammation, used to simulate conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. By observing neutrophils in Spint1a-deficient larvae treated and untreated with a chronic inflammation inhibitor over four hours, we were able to extract a range of morphometric and kinetic parameters. Subsequent statistical and multivariate analyses distinguished significant differences between treated and untreated neutrophils. Furthermore, a Random Forest model identified key features such as sphericity, speed, and lysozyme expression that distinguish between the two neutrophil populations. Principal Component Analysis identified two distinct neutrophil populations, termed "Potentially Beneficial" and "Potentially Dangerous." To further refine this classification, a separated Random Forest model was developed, which utilized morphological parameters such as cell area, volume, and ellipsoid axis length as key features. This model effectively distinguished between the two populations, underscoring the importance of these parameters in identifying the potential impact of neutrophils on disease progression. This approach enhances our understanding of neutrophil behaviors in disease contexts and also identifies potential markers for evaluating new treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases, highlighting the potential of integrating behavioral analysis with molecular and spatial profiling technologies.
